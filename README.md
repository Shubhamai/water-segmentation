# About 
Due to global warming, sources of water are chaing quite dramtically over the years, **A place which was a big lake few year ago, now it's a land!!**. 

So, that's why i made this project to help finding water sources automatically from satellite images using by **Image Segmentation** using **Deep Learning & Computer Vision**.  


So, here are some details about the project -

- The  DL model takes an image and then outputs another image but it contains segmentation between water and simply background/land.


# Built With [![forthebadge made-with-python](http://ForTheBadge.com/images/badges/made-with-python.svg)](https://www.python.org/)
- [FastAI](https://www.fast.ai/) - This is the library to build the DL Model ( Unet ) and training, inference.   
- [Weights & Biases](https://www.wandb.com/) - I did a lot of experimentation, so Weights & Biases helpes me a lot of saving my experiments. 
And bunch of other libraries including os, time, numpy, cv2. 

# Getting Started

Below are the steps to run the application in your PC or laptop, whatever. 

##  Prerequisites

- Python 3.x - You can download python in [Official Python Site](https://www.python.org/).   

## Installation

### Through Github 

1. Clone the repo using `git clone https://github.com/Shubhamai/mask-detector-app.git`
2. Open the terminal and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run `streamlit run app.py`
4. Enjoy üéä

### Docker üê≥

The docker image is avalible in the [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/shubhamai/maskapp). 

# Usage

You will need to first signup to the application, use whatever email or password and then hit signup.
